    <p>Paris began as a small Celtic Village, then became a Roman City called Lutetia. It grew into the Capital of France and played a big role in events like the French Revolution. Over time, it became known for its art, fashion, and culture. Today Paris is a modern, global city that still retains its historic charm.</p>

    <p>The Eiffel Tower was built in Paris for the 1889 World's Fair; it was designed by Gustave Eiffel's Company and took about two years to complete. At first, many people didn't like it, but over time it became one of the most popular landmarks in the world. Today, it's a symbol of Paris and visited by millions every year.</p>
